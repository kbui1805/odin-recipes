        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These boiled chicken wontons are delicately flavored and would go great in a chicken-based soup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, minced</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 green onion, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>50 wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>2 cups cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix chicken, egg, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, vegetable oil, and salt in a large bowl until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Scoop about 1 teaspoon chicken mixture and place into the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten 2 adjacent edges of the wrapper with water and fold into a triangle. Connect the two lower points of the wrapper and moisten to seal and make a hat shape. Repeat with remaining chicken and wonton wrappers.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Stir wontons into boiling water. Add 1/2 cup cold water and allow water to return to a boil. Repeat boiling with another 1/2 cup cold water. Wontons are ready when chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        </ol>
